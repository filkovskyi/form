## Getting Started React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# then
npm run dev
```




## Decision Document: Login Form

# Introduction
The Login Form is a critical component of the application as it serves as the initial touchpoint for users to access their accounts. This document outlines the decisions made during the development of the LoginForm component, covering trade-offs, potential improvements, and strategies for maintaining the feature in production.

# Trade-offs Considered:

# Emulated API Request
- Decision: To simulate a real-world scenario, an emulated API POST request with a 2-second delay was implemented.
- Reason: Mimicking real-world network latency provides a more authentic user experience during login attempts.
- Trade-off: It introduces a delay in the feedback loop during testing

# Loading Spinner
- Decision: A loading spinner is displayed during form submission to indicate the ongoing process.
- Reason: It offers clear visual feedback to the user that their action is being processed.
- Trade-off: The loading spinner adds complexity to the UI, which could potentially confuse users if not implemented correctly.

# Error Handling
- Decision: Errors are displayed inline below the respective input fields.
- Reason: This provides immediate feedback to the user about validation errors.
- Trade-off: Inline error messages can clutter the UI, making it less visually appealing.

# Show/Hide Password Toggle
- Decision: A button to toggle password visibility is provided.
- Reason: It offers flexibility to the user to view their password while typing.
- Trade-off: It adds an extra UI element which could potentially distract some users.

# If I Had More Time...
- Enhanced Styling: Given more time, I would refine the UI with more sophisticated styling to improve the overall user experience.
- Additional Features: Implementation of features like "Forgot Password" or "Remember Me" to enhance the user convenience.
- Unit and Integration Tests: More comprehensive test coverage to ensure all edge cases are handled correctly.

## Maintaining Bug-Free Production
- Testing
- Automated Tests: Maintain a robust suite of unit and integration tests.
- Manual Testing: Regularly perform manual testing to catch any edge cases not covered by automated tests.

# Monitoring and Logging
- Error Tracking: Implement error tracking tools to monitor and log any errors that occur in production.
- Performance Monitoring: Monitor the performance of the login process to identify and rectify any bottlenecks.

# Code Reviews and Quality Assurance
- Code Reviews: Regularly review the codebase to ensure best practices are followed and potential issues are caught early.
- Quality Assurance: Implement a rigorous QA process to catch and fix bugs before they reach production.

## Storing User Credentials
# Storage Choice
- Decision: Use a secure database to store hashed user credentials.
- Reason: Hashing passwords ensures that even if the database is compromised, passwords remain encrypted and secure.

# Schema
```
Users Collection
_id: Object ID
username: String (unique)
passwordHash: String
```

## Managing Application Sessions
# Session Management
- Decision: Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management.
- Reason: JWTs are stateless, scalable, and secure, making them a suitable choice for managing user sessions.

# Implementation
# Login:
- Generate a JWT upon successful login.
- Set the JWT in a HttpOnly cookie for enhanced security.

# Authentication:
- Validate the JWT for each request to authenticate the user.

# Session Expiry and Refresh
- Decision: Set an expiry time for JWTs and implement token refresh mechanism.
- Reason: To ensure enhanced security and maintain user authentication during their session.

## Conclusion
The decisions made for the LoginForm component were driven by the need to provide a secure, user-friendly, and robust login experience. By implementing the outlined strategies for maintaining the feature in production and managing user credentials and sessions, we aim to deliver a reliable and secure login process for the application.
